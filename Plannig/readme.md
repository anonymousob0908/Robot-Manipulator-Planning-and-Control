The GJK algorithm is suitable for detecting collisions between convex polyhedra. In this implementation, the robotic arm links (cylinders) are approximated as 12-sided prisms, generated in generate_prism.m. Similarly, the heart-shaped obstacle is approximated, with its vertices and faces stored in loveshape.m. Note that the GJK algorithm only applies to convex polyhedra, so the heart shape is divided into two separate obstacles that must be checked individually. The GJK algorithm is implemented in GJK.m for reference https://gitcode.com/open-source-toolkit/d45cf. The maintest.m program can be used to directly verify the correctness of the GJK implementation. In check_collision.m, collision checks are performed sequentially for circular obstacles, rectangular obstacles, and irregular obstacles. The parameters of the BiRRT* algorithm are adjusted to ensure a feasible path can be found, and the subsequent optimization process remains consistent with the trajectory optimization procedure.
